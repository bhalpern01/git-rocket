Git Rocket
=============

A script for when you need to stop coding and save your changes in a hurry.

Installation
------------

*   Move the "rocket" file to ~/bin and add +x permissions.
*   Add "alias elvis='rocket'" to your ~/.bash_aliases file. (because he might be leaving the building with you!)
*   "exec bash" to reload your aliases

That's it!

How to use it
-------------

# Be inside a git repo
# Run "rocket" (or "elvis")
